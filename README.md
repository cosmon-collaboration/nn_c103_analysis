# nn_c103_analysis

The code in this repository performs analysis of the two-nucleon system on the C103 ensemble, providing an update to the calculation and results presented in [2009.11825](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11825).  In the present analysis, we perform a more sophisticated analysis of the two-nucleon correlators (as described in some detail below) and we also perform an analysis of the HAL Potential computed on the same ensemble.

The Lüscher Analysis (contained in the `luscher` folder) is performed with an update of the code used to perform the analysis in [2009.11825](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11825).

The HAL Potential Analysis (contained in the `hal-qcd` folder) is new software designed with guidance from the HAL QCD Collaboration.

We describe how to run both suites of code below:
- [Lüscher](#luscher-analysis)
- [HAL Potential](#hal-potential-analysis)
