To fit our HAL QCD potential data, we discussed using 3 models
- Yukawa with Gaussian regulator + r-weighted Woods-Saxon potentials.   Motivation:   This is the core of the S-channel Av18 potential which multiples a Woods-Saxon potential by a quadratic in $\mu r$ to fit the hard core and intermediate range.  The Yukawa regulator $1 - \exp(-c r^2)$ removes the non-physical short range behavior that comes from assuming that nucleons are point particles.
- Yukawa with Gaussian regulator + r-weighted Gaussians.    Motiviation:  r-weighted Gaussians are equivilent to the harmonic oscillator basis, which is complete.    You can include more powers of r and get improved representation of compact functions like the potential minus the regulated Yukawa.
- sum of Gaussians (as HAL QCD does), or is it r-weighted gaussians.   Motiviation:   We will do this mostly because HAL QCD did.   R-weighted Gaussians will eventually work with accurate long range data, but will require many powers to properly represent the tail.  The problem is that we don't have accurate long range data to configure the tail that we know must have a Yukawa form.  

A starting paper for understanding the Gaussian regulated Yukawa and the Woods-Saxon potentials is the original AV18 paper
