To fit our HAL QCD potential data, we discussed using 3 models
- Yukawa with Gaussian regulator + r-weighted Woods-Saxon potentials
- Yukawa with Gaussian regulator + r-weighted Gaussians
- sum of Gaussians (as HAL QCD does), or is it r-weighted gaussians

A starting paper for understanding the Gaussian regulated Yukawa and the Woods-Saxon potentials is the original AV18 paper
